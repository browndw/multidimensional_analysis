## Multidimensitonal Analysis
This repository contains a function and accomanying notebook for carrying out Multidimenstional Analysis, as well as evaluating and plotting the results in R.

MDA is statistical procedure developed and pioneered by [Douglas Biber](https://www.jstor.org/stable/30204629?seq=1). In linguistic analysis, MDA can be useful in:

1. Reducing a large number of linguistic variables into a small number of factors
1. Aggregrating variables that correlate both positively and negatively into a factor
1. Summarizizing a general tendency

The procedure broadly invovles a series of 4 steps:

1. Identification of relevant variables
1. Extraction of factors from variables
1. Functional interpretation of factors as dimensions
1. Placement of categories on the dimensions

The code included in the notebook can extract factors and generate appropriate plots. But the functional interpretation is up the analyst.
